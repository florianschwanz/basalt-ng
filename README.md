## Purpose

Basalt is an Angular based web application that helps you structure your work in a multi-tasking environment - you may call it a have-done list.

In order to structure your work you can note what you just did as a _tasklet_ which is a small work item belonging to a larger topic. That way you keep track of
* all your current tasks
* meeting minutes
* todos
* ideas

Find all your tasklets by
* tags
* projects
* full-text search

Don't miss any important information. Be able to report what you spent your time with. Keep your head free to focus on things that matter most.
